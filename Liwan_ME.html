            <p> 
                First you'll marinate the chicken in a mix of yogurt and warming spices. You can marinate for 2 hours, but you'll get much more flavor penetration if you marinate overnight.

                Next, par boil the rice in water with the whole spices, just enough to soften the rice a bit, but not cook it all the way through. Drain the rice.

                Meanwhile, lightly fry thinly sliced onions in oil over medium heat until they start to crisp up and turn golden brown, 10 minutes or so.

                Bloom the saffron in warm milk or warm water a couple minutes.

                Set it all aside and we can now make the biryani!

                First, partially cook the marinated chicken (with the marinade) in a large pot, just a couple minutes per side.

                Spread the partially cooked rice over the the top, then a layer of fried onions, then a bit of fresh chopped cilantro, then drizzle over the saffron mix.

                Cover the pot and simmer the whole pot for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is done and the rice is nice and fluffy.

                Boom! Done! Your biryani is ready to serve. Easy enough to make, isn't it? Serve it as a flavorful side dish, or make an extra batch and serve it as your main.

                Sprinkle on lemon juice for a fresh touch of acidity!
