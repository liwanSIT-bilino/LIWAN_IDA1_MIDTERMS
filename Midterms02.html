                <p>
                    In World War II Japan, a teenager and his little sister are left to fend for themselves after their mother dies in the massive bombing of Kobe. 
                    They find refuge in a disused bunker lit up at night by thousands of fireflies. A masterpiece of Japanese animation, inspired by a semi-autobiographical short story of the same name.
